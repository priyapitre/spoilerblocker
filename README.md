A google chrome extension that blocks spoilers from ruining your favorite shows and movies!

How to get it:
1) Download the entire folder from Github.
2) Open google chrome- go to Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Turn on developer mode -> then Load Unpacked and drop this folder there.
3) And that's it! You should be able to see the icon of this extension in the top right.

How to use it:
- Click on the icon, enter the name of any TV show, movie, actor, an ex (anything you want to really!), and you shall see it and the context of it blurred on any page that has it.
- You will see the entered words appear at the bottom.
- Click on the red cross that appears at the bottom to remove a specific word from that list.

Special Features:
- Works better than a Regex based blocker!
- Blocks even "Top Stories" and "People Also Search" sections of the search, which most blockers out there don't.
- Has an on/off button- so if you get sick of seeing the blurs on a specific page, just turn off the extension using the button. No hassle of removing the word, then remembering to get it back later.
- It is possible to sync the words saved on the extension, once its published on Chrome Web Store. Till then there is no way to cloud sync, given how Chrome Extensions work. (That is, only the Web Store one's can be seen on a different device, developer mode one's can't. But that can be fixed soon :) )

Current Inconviniences: 
1> NOTE: This version of the extension is case sensitive. Meaning, just writing 'star' does not block any sites that could have the word 'Star'. That will be fixed soon.
Till then, make sure you are typing 'Star', 'star' and 'STAR' to avoid the maximum number of blockers (almost all of them)!
